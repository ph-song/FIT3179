    <h1>World's Economic</h1>
    <div id = "outer">
        <div>
            <h2>GDP per capita of each country</h2>
            <div id="g1" class="viz"></div>
            <p>
                The GNI per capita is the dollar value of a country's final income in a year, 
                divided by its population. It should be reflecting the average before tax 
                income of a country's citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing a country's GNI per capita is a good first step toward understanding 
                the country's economic strengths and needs, as well as the general standard 
                of living enjoyed by the average citizen. A country's GNI per capita tends 
                to be closely linked with other indicators that measure the social, economic, 
                and environmental well-being of the country and its people.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Number of countrirs of each income class</h2>
            <div id="g4" class="viz"></div>
            <p>
                The World Bank assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, 
                lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries. The classifications 
                are updated each year on July 1 and are based on GNI per capita in current 
                USD (using the Atlas method exchange rates) of the previous year
            </p>
            <p>
                The classifications change for two reasons:
                <ol>
                <li>
                1. In each country, factors such as economic growth, inflation, exchange rates, 
                and population growth influence GNI per capita. Revisions to national accounts 
                methods and data can also have an influence in specific cases. The updated data 
                on GNI per capita data for 2020 can be accessed here.

                </li>
                <li>
                2. To keep the income classification thresholds fixed in real terms, 
                they are adjusted annually for inflation. The Special Drawing Rights 
                (SDR) deflator is used, which is a weighted average of the GDP deflators 
                of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro Area. 
                This year, the thresholds moved up in line with this inflation measure.
                </li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services 
                from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates 
                from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or 
                government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences 
                in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from 
                one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's 
                currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, 
                even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its 
                population.
