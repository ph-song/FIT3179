        <h2>World Economies by GNI per capita</h2>
        <div id="g1"></div>
        <p id="sec1_text" class="text">
            The GNI per capita is the dollar value of a country's final income in a year, 
            divided by its population. It should be reflecting the average before tax 
            income of a country's citizens.
            <br><br>
            Knowing a country's GNI per capita is a good first step toward understanding 
            the country's economic strengths and needs, as well as the general standard 
            of living enjoyed by the average citizen. A country's GNI per capita tends 
            to be closely linked with other indicators that measure the social, economic, 
            and environmental well-being of the country and its people.

        <h2>Number of Economies by Income Group</h2>
        <div id="g2" class="viz"></div>
        <p id="sec2_text">
            The World Bank assigns the world’s economies to four income groups—low, 
            lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries. The classifications 
            are updated each year on July 1 and are based on GNI per capita in current 
            USD (using the Atlas method exchange rates) of the previous year.
            <br><br>
            The classifications change due to factors such as economic growth, inflation, exchange rates, 
            and population growth influence GNI per capita. Revisions to national accounts 
            methods and data can also have an influence in specific cases. The updated data 
            on GNI per capita data for 2020 can be accessed here.
            <br><br>
            Other than that, to keep the income classification thresholds fixed in real terms, 
            they are adjusted annually for inflation. The <strong>Special Drawing Rights (SDR)</strong>
             deflator is used, which is a weighted average of the GDP deflators 
            of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro Area. 
            This year, the thresholds moved up in line with this inflation measure.

            <strong>Gross domestic product (GDP)</strong> is the market value of all final goods and services 
            from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates 
            from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or 
            government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences 
            in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from 
            one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's 
            currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, 
            even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its 
            population.
